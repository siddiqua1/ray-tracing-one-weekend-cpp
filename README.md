# ray-tracing-one-weekend-cpp

## Requirements

For compiling this project from source you will need the following

- CMake 3.15 or later
- C++20 Compiler

## Building

```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

It recommended to build for release which you can do so with the following command

```shell
cmake --build build --config release
```

### Docker

To build using Docker first create the Docker image using the following command

```shell
docker build -t ray-tracing .
```

Then to run the container you need to ensure that the `output` directory from teh docker image is mounted to some local directory so that outputted `.png` files can be viewed.

```shell
mkdir -p $(pwd)/output
docker run -v $(pwd)/output:/output ray-tracing
```

## Cleaning

```shell
cmake --build build --target clean
```

## Applications

The project builds multiple binaries corresponding to the various checkpoints in the series. The following is a render generated by the last checkpoint.

_Note:_ Generated files are in the `.ppm` format as they are easy to write to. You will need a likely need a converter to view locally.

### Roadmap

- [x] Get first iteration from the book working
- [x] Update codebase to use more modern C++ and CMake features
- [ ] Benchmarking framework
- [ ] Render modes
  - Toggle between file out put and live render
- [ ] Wasm build for live in browser render
- [ ] Optimize codebase (ECS?)
